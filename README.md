Implementation of the [Spring Pet Clinic]  backend using a REST backend implented with **Spring Weblux** and **Apache Cassandra** for the backend. This is meant to be used with the **[spring-petclinic-angular](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular)** user interface, all steps are listed here to run the full app stay with us.

## Run the Application on your laptop

### A1 - Create a DBaas Cassandra free Account (ASTRA)

`DataStax ASTRA` service is available at url [https://astra.datastax.com](https://astra.datastax.com/)

**‚úÖ Step 1a.Register (if needed) and Sign In to Astra** : You can use your `Github`, `Google` accounts or register with an `email`

- [Registration Page](https://astra.datastax.com/register)

![TodoBackendClient](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/microservices-java-workshop-online/blob/master/z-materials/images/astra-create-register.png?raw=true)

- [Authentication Page](https://astra.datastax.com/)

![TodoBackendClient](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/microservices-java-workshop-online/blob/master/z-materials/images/astra-create-login.png?raw=true)


**‚úÖ Step 1b. Fill the Create New Database Form** : As you don't have have any instances the login will route through the instance creation form. You will find below which values to enter for each field.

- *Initialization Form*
![TodoBackendClient](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/microservices-java-workshop-online/blob/master/z-materials/images/astra-create-2.png?raw=true)

- **Set the Compute Size**: For the work we are doing please use `Free tier`. You instance will be there forever, free of charge. If you already have a free tier db that you created in a previous workshop (`killrvideo`) you can reuse it.

- **Select region**: This is the region where your database will reside physically (choose one close to you or your users). For people in EMEA please use `europe-west-1` idea here is to reduce latency.

- **Fill in the database name** - Proposed value `dev-workshop-db`. You can use any alphanumeric value it is not part of the connection fields. Now it will be part of a file downloaded later and you should avoid capital letters.

With the 3 fields below you can pick any name

- **Fill in the keyspace name** - Proposed value `todoapp` (no spaces, alpha numeric)

- **Fill in the user name** - `todouser`. Note the user name is case-sensitive. Please use the case we suggest here.

- **Fill in the user password** - `todopassword`. Fill in both the password and the confirmation fields. Note that the password is also case-sensitive. Please use the case we suggest here.

- **Launch the database**. Review all the fields to make sure they are as shown, and click the Launch Database button.

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

**‚úÖ Step 1c. View your Database and connect** : View your database. It may take 2-3 minutes for your database to spin up. You will receive an email at that point.

**üëÅÔ∏è Expected output**

*Initializing*

*Database is ready*

### A2 - Build and start the Angular  user interface

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular.git
cd spring-petclinic-angular
npm uninstall -g angular-cli @angular/cli
npm cache clean
npm install -g @angular/cli@8.0.3
npm install --save-dev @angular/cli@8.0.3
```


### A3 - Build and start the Spring Boot backend



Talk is cheap, show me the code.




You should now have the UI running at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)


## BUILD AND RUN THE BACKEND

- Create Astra account + DB
- Download the cloudSecureBundle
- Setup `application.yaml` with `keyspace-name`, `username`, `password` and `secure-connect-bundle`

```yaml
spring.data.cassandra:
  keyspace-name: spring_petclinic
  username: petclinic
  password: petclinic
  schema-action: CREATE_IF_NOT_EXISTS
  request:
    timeout: 10s
  connection:
    connect-timeout: 10s
    init-query-timeout: 10s

datastax.astra:
  enabled: true
  secure-connect-bundle: /Users/cedricklunven/Downloads/secure-connect-demos.zip

```

## Run with local Cassandra

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Access application, it should redirect you to documentation
```
http://localhost:8081/
```

## Run with ASTRA
